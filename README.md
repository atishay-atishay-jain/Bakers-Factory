# Bakers-Factory

It is mini project on design patterns in java. The basic goal is to make the chocolate cake with shakes(either strawberry or vanilla) and generate bill by developing a user-friendly program using 2 design patterns: Template Method and Decorator pattern to formulate the task of stating procedure, constructing types and adding flavours respectively. The program is definitely open-closed principle specific. Any future accommodations and modifications are kept into the mind and the code can deliver enough scope for future engagements.
